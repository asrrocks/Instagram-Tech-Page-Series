                <summary>#Fact1 - First Impression is the Last Impression</summary>
                <p>
                    It takes less than a second, for a user to make his/her view on the organization by its initial
                    experience through its web page. It is very significant to make the first impression as the best for
                    everyone who lands on the page with the help of adequate background theme, fonts, icon designs,
                    color combinations, proper animations(if required), layout, and maintaining the sections of the page
                    in a well-designed manner. The first and most significant role for standing out through digital
                    means is played by Web Development.

                <summary>#Fact2 - Easy, Easier, Easiest</summary>
                <p>
                    Web development uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create responsive and attractive websites which
                    are far easier than software development or android application development comparatively because in
                    the native applications code should be programmed according to the platform because of the
                    significant difference in language and processes resulting extra resources and skills to be familiar
                    with it. But a web page has just to be built once with cross-browser support which not only makes it
                    ready to use in all devices but also reaches a greater number of audiences. After all, the number
                    matters the most for an organization.

                <summary>#Fact3 - Interrelation of Code and SEO</summary>
                <p>
                    Your website should be the one that can stand out there. Many developers do not keep this point in
                    their mind while writing the codes but each word can have a great impact to affect the reach of the
                    page. Source code should be written considering SEO(Search Engine Optimization) which increases the
                    rankings in search engines. Page titles and tags should be focused on during development.
